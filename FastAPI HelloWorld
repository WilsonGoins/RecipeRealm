A guide on how to start this project using FastAPI on PyCharm

1. Open this project in PyCharm
2. Copy and Paste the following code into main.py (insure there are no comments above it)
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()


    @app.get("/")
    async def root():
        return {"message": "Hello World"}
3. Install "fastapi" by hovering over "fastapi" in the first line of the previous code
   or by running "pip install fastapi" in your terminal.
4. Then install "uvicorn" by running "pip install uvicorn" in your terminal.

    over it to install.
5. Run "uvicorn app:app --reload" in your terminal. This is what we will use to always start the web app
