main.py will be the brain of our web application
models.py will be our closest connection with SQLite
database.py will be the connection from app.py to database
api.js will connect React ot FastAPI
app.js is the brain of our front end that connects to app.py

Errors I ran into:
When you get to around 19 minute mark and you have to run "npx create-react-app finance-app" it may not work.
    If it doesn't work run "npm install npm -g" then try again
