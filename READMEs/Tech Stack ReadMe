main.py will be the brain of our web application
models.py will be our closest connection with SQLite
database.py will be the connection from app.py to database
api.js will connect React ot FastAPI
app.js is the brain of our front end that connects to app.py

Errors I ran into:
 - When you get to around 19 minute mark and you have to run "npx create-react-app finance-app" it may not work.
   If it doesn't work run "npm install npm -g" then try again
 - I somehow created node_modules outside of the finance-app folder. The only node_modules folder should be within the finance-app folder
 - I was not inside the finance-app directory when I ran "npm install axios" and so it didn't download to the correct spot
 - Got Axios Network Error
   I wasn't running the back end. So once you do "npm start" you need to also cd into FastAPI in a new terminal and run
   "uvicorn main:app --reload" to run the backend. Make sure you do this in a different terminal
