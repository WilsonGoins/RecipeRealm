A ReadMe for new users on how to get this project running on their own machine

1. First we need to install several backend dependencies. In a terminal run:
    pip install fastapi
    pip install sqlalchemy
    pip install uvicorn
2. We will now download the frontend dependencies:
    a. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and download the correct version of Node.js
        i. Double click on it in files and select "open with Windows Installer".
        ii. Once installed, restart your computer
    b. Now we just need to run the following commands in a terminal:
        npm install npm -g
        npm install react-router-dom
2. Close that terminal and open two new terminals. One will run the front end, the other will run the back end
3. First, in one terminal run:
    cd .\FastAPI\ | uvicorn main:app --reload
    a. If you get the error that uvicorn is not recognized, instead run
        cd .\FastAPI\ | python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

4. Now, in the other terminal you opened, run:
    cd React/recipe-realm-app | npm start
5. This will automatically open the react app in your browser, and everything is ready to go!
